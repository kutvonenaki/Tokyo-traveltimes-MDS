# Tokyo-traveltimes-MDS
**Use nbviewer to see the jupyter code file correctly**

This small programs takes coordinates as inputs and uses google maps distance_matrix api to calculate travel times between the points. Then multidimensional scaling is used to map the places to 2 dimensions based on the travel times betwen the places. As an example we use points in Tokyo and compare driving in traffic vs. dirving withouth traffic. At this time google maps api doesn't allow public transport search in Tokyo.
